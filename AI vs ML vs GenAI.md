*  Gen AI Topics


# AI 

* Build Application that can perform its own task with human intervention.
* Ex : Movie Recommendation , Self Driving Car 

# ML

* Subset of AI
* stat tools to perform the complete life cycle of a project using data. 

# Deep Learning 

* Subset of Machine Learning .
* This is mimicing human brain. 
* Multi Layered Nural Network. 
    * ANN
    * CNN and Object Detection - Computer Vision
    * RNN & its variant - Text Related Use cases and Time series Use cases .
        * Transformer 
        * BERT 

* Type of Deep Learning Models :
    * Discriminative Models 
        * Classification
        * Prediction 
        * Trained on Labeled Dataset
    * Generative Models
        * LLM ( Large Language Model) - Text 
        * LIM ( Large Image Model ) - Image
        * Generates new data as it is trained on huge amount of data 
        * Based on any input it generates new data itself.


# Genearative AI
* Subset of Deep Learning !!

* LLM Models : - Foundation and Pre Trained Models which are trained on Huge amount of data available on the Internet.
* Example :
    * OpenAI - GPT4 
    * Meta - LAMA2
    * Google - Gemini , Gemma
    * Antopic - Cloude3 

* They can also be used for domain specific use cases and for that Fine Tuning is required with own custom dataset.

* Lang Chain  - is a framework which will be used to work with these models. 

* We can generate REG Application / RAG Application
